## Future Plans

### Game

- Transition to Mario Platformer like game _optional_
  - Handwritten level design increases link counts
- Powerups
- Additional monsters and obstacles
- Additional player mechanics (like ducking)

### Trojan

- Add server to receive encryption key
- Multiple options for the trojan
  1. Encrypt files
  2. Leak to Social Media
  3. Keylogging
  4. Screenshot send to server
  5. Listen to and play sounds to user
  6. Decrypt if they get high score in game (only one file) increases ransom?
