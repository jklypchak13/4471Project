# Trojan Horse

A game guise for a nefarious second purpose, non-chalantly named "Trojan Horse".
While the **victim** plays a `2D` platformer with a Troy theme, in a second
process the user's files are encrypted and the encrypted key is sent
to a private server to be ransomed for later on. ðŸ˜ˆ

## Pdf Inator

This project must be submitted with solely `pdf` files, therefore we have a
little script file to make this easier!

```sh

# or
$ pip install fpdf --user

$ pipenv run python pdf_inator.py
```

Creates `pdf/` directory which has a copied `pdf` structure of `src/`
